# Find-a-Friend
Mod for Persona 4 Golden PC that allows you to see all available social links and travel to them in a single click.

The field.bf and field.msg are the current and working versions.
The fieldhook.bf and fieldhook.msg were my failed attempts at making hooking work with this. You can use them to see what's edited in the working files, however the code in them may be outdated compared to the current versions.
